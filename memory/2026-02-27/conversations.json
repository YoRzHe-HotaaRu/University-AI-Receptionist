Tuition fees vary depending on your specific program of study and residency status (in-state vs. out-of-state).\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date figures, I recommend visiting our **Financial Aid and Bursar's Office website**. There, you can find detailed fee schedules for each department.\n\nRegarding financial aid, we typically offer a range of options including:\n*   Merit-based scholarships\n*   Need-based grants\n*   Federal student loans\n*   Work-study programs\n\nWould you like me to provide you with the direct link to the financial aid application page, or do you have questions about eligibility requirements?",
